This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for learning modules of Steinbeis Schools for Next Practices.
For instructions how to setup your working environment, open the file "SetupEnvironment.md" above.

Topics:
- Introduction to Python
- Data management (HTTP requests, APIs)
- Data exploration (Pandas, Matplotlib)

It is recommended to install python and jupyter locally on your computer and download the notebooks. Although you can use any online environment to work on the notebooks if you prefer that. You find instructions and options in the Notebook "SetupInstructions.ipynb" above.

You can use an online coding environment by clicking the "Open in Binder" which is provided in the repository. This may take a couple of minutes to open; please be patient and avoid refreshing your browser window as this will restart the process.
